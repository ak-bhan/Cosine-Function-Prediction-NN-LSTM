Predicting the Next Value of Cosine Function using Neural Networks.

# Cosine Function Prediction using Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting the next value of the cosine function using neural networks. The goal is to demonstrate how neural networks can be utilized for time series prediction tasks. The model is trained on a portion of the cosine function and tested on the remaining part to evaluate its performance.

## Key Features

- Utilizes a feedforward neural network with multiple layers for regression.
- Demonstrates data preprocessing, including MinMax scaling and sequence creation.
- Provides code to visualize the predicted values against the actual function.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn installed.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script and run the code.

## Usage

1. Run the provided code to train the neural network on the cosine function data.
2. After training, the model will predict the next value in the cosine function based on previous values.
3. The predicted values will be visualized against the actual cosine function for comparison.

## Acknowledgments

The code in this repository is inspired by the need to explore neural network capabilities in time series prediction tasks.
